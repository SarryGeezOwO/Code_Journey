# Code Journey

<p>
  This repository is a collection of programs I created or copied from various sources, this collection of mine is to 
  learn various techniques, algorithms, and design patterns. most works here will be made using Java but occasionally some 
  will be created using Go
</p>
<br>

### Softwares I use
> for learning effectively, and easy

* <b>ChatGPT</b> - for getting a easy to understand analogies and provide some informations I have to look up in the internet for more details.
* <b>NotePad</b> - for writing important details on the lessons I learned. I personally use my self-made notepad for funsies.
* <b>JDoodle</b> - for quick code and to see results without creating a project.

<h3>details :</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each programs are stored in their respective directories</li>
  <li>Some programs contains comment some don't</li>
  <li>Some programs includes a .exe file, although Java might needed to run, atleast Java 8 and above will work
  <li>Some programs are literally just copies of a content creators code, but I only did this for learning purposes</li>
  <li>All Programs are not necessarilly made in Java, some might be made using Go</li>
  <li>Big Thanks to these content creators, they teach a lot of good stuffs</li>
