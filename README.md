<p>This repository contains all challenges I took on with or without help. I'm still young and novice when it comes to programming and making algorithms.
So I hope in the future i can confindetly create complex programs and Algorithms. I particularly am interested in 3D engines and how it works in full detail.
I also like doing simulations.</p>

<h3>details :</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All programs inside this repository are made using JAVA.</li>
  <li>All projects here includes .JAR files and is available to be downloaded if you want to see the result</li>
  <li>Huge thanks to "The coding train", this youtube channel helped me so much to learn new things.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Note : Don't expect high levels of algorithms and programming skills.</h5>
